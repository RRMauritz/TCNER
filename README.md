# TCNER Project:
Conference prediction for research papers via various machine-learning models. We look at one class of models that use the bag-of-words approach together with TFIDF-ing: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression & Support Vector Machines. The other class uses word-embedding and takes the relational structure into account via an LSTM core.
